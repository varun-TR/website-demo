Quarto is a multi-language, next-generation version of R Markdown from Posit and includes dozens of new features and capabilities while at the same being able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.\nIn this tutorial, we'll show you how to use RStudio with Quarto. You'll edit code and markdown in RStudio just as you would with any computational document (e.g., R Markdown) and preview the rendered document in the Viewer tab as you work.\nThe following is a Quarto document with the extension .qmd (on the left), along with its rendered version as HTML (on the right). You could also choose to render it into other formats like PDF, MS Word, etc."

    "text": "This page is dedicated to breaking down the science behind any phenomenon or substance involves a meticulous examination of its fundamental principles, properties, and interactions at various levels of scale. Whether it’s delving into the molecular structure of a chemical compound, analyzing the biomechanics of a physical process, or exploring the intricate workings of a biological system, scientific inquiry aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms that govern its behavior and characteristics. This often entails experimentation, observation, and theoretical modeling to elucidate the intricate relationships between different components and their roles in shaping the overall phenomenon. Through this systematic approach, scientists can gain a deeper understanding of the intricacies of nature and harness this knowledge to advance various fields, from medicine and technology to environmental science and beyond."
